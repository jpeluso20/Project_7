# Project_7
This is the code that I have written for project 7. 
Through this code you will be able to play a small adventure game with mulitple exits and hidden keys and rooms throughout! When you download all the code, run the play_game.py script and enter spooky_mansion.json in order to play the right game.
Have fun.
